# MD Site Documentation

Welcome to the MD Site! This project is designed to be a flexible, file-based Markdown Static Site Generator (SSG) where content MD (Markdown) files are completely separated from the renderer (the Nuxt framework).

Our goal is to allow content creators to write simple Markdown files while this project provide a robust, high-performance rendering engine that can be deployed anywhere (like Cloudflare Pages).

## Getting Started

### 0. Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 20.0.0)
- NPM (>= 10.0.0)
- Git

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gizbar/md-site.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd md-site

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Starting the Project

The most common way to start the project is using the `npm start` command.

```bash
# Start the project with the default `content.config.yml` configuration
npm start
```

By running this command, you should see this documentation site running at `http://localhost:3000`.

This command does several things behind the scenes:
1.  **Reads Configuration**: It looks for `content.config.yml` (or `.yaml`) in the root directory.
2.  **Starts the Watcher**: It fires up the `sync-content.ts` script to watch for file changes.
3.  **Launches Nuxt**: It starts the local development server.

> [!NOTE]
> The `/docs` directory contains this documentation as sample content to get you started. You can create your own content at any other location and configure it independantly.

#### Multiple domains

If you want to start the project with a different configuration file, you can specify the domain as a parameter:

```bash
# Start the project with the `example.config.yml` configuration instead of the default `content.config.yml`
npm start example
```

For every domain (like `example`), there must be a corresponding configuration file in the root directory:

**Example: `example.config.yaml`**
```yaml
contentPath: "../relative/path/to/content"
# Add other specific configurations here
```

The content does not have to live inside the same project as your md-cms project. You can point it to any directory you want. Preferrably you want to keep it in a separate git repository so that you can version control your content independantly.

If you don't provide a `contentPath`, the system defaults to assuming your content is in `../md-content/<domain>`.
